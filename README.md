## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned more about CSS specifically 'grid' and 'flex', I used these elements to section and position the content. I also learned how to use Chrome's "inspect" tool to improve the styling of elements.


### Continued development

I will continue advancing to improve the structure of the styles and elements. Researching good practices.
